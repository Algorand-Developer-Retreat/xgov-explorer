Each product will be traceable, it can be segmented by country to avoid contraband and also the nft will certify the authenticity of the product.

On top of that, this proposal will allow us to provide a tenfold increase in our API bandwidth and high availability with an uptime equal to or very close to 100%.

      description:
        "This grant request outlines our proposal to develop innovative GitHub tools that leverage decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) principles and the Algorand blockchain to manage source code through onchain voting decisions. The project aims to empower developers and communities by providing a transparent and efficient platform for collaborative decision-making and consensus-building. The proposed solution centers around the utilization of Vote Coin standard on the Algorand blockchain to facilitate onchain voting processes. By integrating Vote Coin standard into GitHub's existing infrastructure, we aim to create a seamless experience for developers, allowing them to propose, discuss, and vote on various aspects of source code management directly within the GitHub platform. The key objectives of this project is: Integration with GitHub: We will build a set of tools and interfaces that seamlessly integrate with GitHub's existing functionality. These tools will enable start of DAO vote on each Pull Request, and after end of the voting session with positive DAO result, the merge of the pull request. The successful implementation of this project will revolutionize source code management by introducing a transparent and democratic decision-making process within the GitHub ecosystem and all allgorand onchain communities. By leveraging the power of Vote Coin and the Algorand blockchain, developers and communities will have a platform to collectively shape the evolution of software projects. We believe that this project has the potential to foster collaboration, innovation, and consensus-building within the software development community, leading to enhanced quality and inclusivity in code development. We kindly request your support in the form of a grant to bring this project to fruition and contribute to the advancement of decentralized governance within the software development ecosystem.",

        "We will improve Algorand's DeFi ecosystem and with concentrated liquidity AMM we will give users better swap quotes and liquidity providers better yields in comparision with using traditional AMMs. This grant proposal aims to advance the development and open source implementation of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) with concentrated liquidity. AMMs have emerged as a crucial component of decentralized finance (DeFi), providing efficient and decentralized mechanisms for trading digital assets. However, traditional AMMs suffer from certain limitations, such as inefficient capital utilization and vulnerability to impermanent loss. Concentrated liquidity models address these issues by allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to concentrate their funds within specific price ranges, thereby enhancing capital efficiency and reducing the risk of impermanent loss. This proposal seeks funding to support research, development, and implementation efforts focused on creating open source algorand AMM smart contract. By supporting this grant proposal, you will contribute to the advancement of decentralized finance by addressing the limitations of traditional AMMs and enhancing capital efficiency and risk management through the implementation of concentrated liquidity models. This research and development effort will foster innovation, attract liquidity providers, and improve the overall user experience in the rapidly evolving Algorand DeFi ecosystem.",

      description:
        "This proposal features three distinct components designed to increase volume and access to liquidity across the Algorand ecosystem. - Integrating Stableswaps and Lending Markets into the Vestige Aggregator, as well as open-sourcing the routing smart contract - Establishing a fully decentralized on-chain aggregator for new dApps to utilize the available liquidity on Algorand - Developing a comprehensive lending platform that leverages existing liquidity for all actions, driving volume towards the entire ecosystem # Component 1: Stableswap and Lending Markets Aggregator Integration We will integrate stableswaps into the Vestige aggregator, enabling tokens like gALGO to have greater utility by providing instant access to swap from gALGO to any other asset in the ecosystem with minimal slippage. This will be achieved by utilizing highly liquid stableswap pools. This milestone also covers integrating Folks Finance lending pools into the Vestige aggregator. These integrations play a pivotal role in optimizing liquidity utilization for bridged and stable assets, leading to a significant reduction in price impact. A 10000 ALGO swap to goBTC through our router nets you over a percent more than doing a single swap, and these integrations will boost this number a lot. This grant will enable us to open-source the smart contract used for the routing, equipping other developers with the necessary tools to create their own complex swap transactions without reinventing the wheel concerning cfAMM swaps, stableswaps and lending market integrations. # Component 2: Fully Decentralized Liquidity Aggregator This component is a fully on-chain, decentralized liquidity aggregator. This on-chain tool will be callable from other dApps, allowing developers to tap into on-chain liquidity programmatically without incurring significant price impact from single-pool swaps. Furthermore, an oracle-like component will be introduced to track on-chain liquidity over time, enabling smart slippage during transaction execution and preventing frontrunning or MEV-like attacks. # Component 3: Decentralized Lending Platform The third component is a fully decentralized lending platform, offering a variety of lending and borrowing options for specific on-chain assets. This protocol will exclusively tap into existing AMMs for managing loans, repayments, and liquidations by leveraging the decentralized liquidity aggregator mentioned earlier. This approach ensures that liquidation incentives and fees remain within the ecosystem, instead of being consumed by bots and moved off-chain, which is a current issue.",

        "Alright is a peer-to-peer agreements app to safely exchange goods & services with anyone through decentralized escrow. It enables two people to lock in an agreement to buy or sell something remotely, secure the deal with collateral as a security deposit, and release the payment when they are both ready. Alright is for any transaction that comes with some counterparty risk of non-performance, and it is faster, easier, and cheaper than using traditional middleman escrow services.",
