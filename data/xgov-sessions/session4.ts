      description:
        "[Proactive] SIWA (Sign In With Algorand) is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to sign in to websites and applications using their Algorand wallet. SIWA is built on the Algorand blockchain and uses implements an Algo-equivalent EIP-4361 to verify user identity. SIWA is fully decentralized, fully compatable with EVM SIWE, secure, and transparent, providing users with a seamless and secure authentication experience. SIWA is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to developers and users worldwide. - **EVM Compatibility**: SIWA will have tight compatibility with SIWE (Sign In With Ethereum), allowing developers to easily integrate SIWA into their existing Ethereum-based applications. - **NextJS Support**: SIWA will support NextJS, a popular React framework, making it easy for developers to build fast and scalable web applications. - **Enterprise Security**: SIWA will provide a best-practices security model and on-chain protocol for enterprise applications, ensuring that user data is secure and protected. Feature 1: EVM Compatibility SIWA will be modeled from the ground up to be compatible with SIWE, allowing developers to easily integrate SIWA into their existing Ethereum-based applications. This is a critical feature for developers who build Algorand applications with NextJS. This is a critical feature for developers who build EVM-compatible applications and want to leverage the Algorand blockchain for authentication. Feature 2: EIP-4361 Equivalent SIWA will implement an EIP-4361 equivalent on the Algorand blockchain. EI-4361 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that defines a standard for decentralized authentication on the Ethereum blockchain. SIWA will provide a similar standard for Algorand, allowing developers to easily integrate decentralized authentication into their applications. Feature 3: NextJS Support SIWA will support NextJS, a popular React framework, making it easy for developers to build fast and scalable web applications. NextJS is a powerful tool for building web applications, and SIWA will provide seamless integration with NextJS, allowing developers to build secure and scalable applications with ease. Feature 4: Wallet/NFD Integration SIWA will integrate with popular Algorand wallets, popular Algorand libraries, and NFD domains. This integration will allow users to easily sign in to websites and applications using their Algorand wallet, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience.",

        '[Proactive] <a href="https://agorapp.dev/" target="_self"> AgorApp</a> is a cutting-edge educational platform, similar to Codecademy, but designed specifically for Web3 chains and protocols. Founded in 2022 and officially launched in the summer of 2023, AgorApp has established strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as Internet Computer Protocol, NEAR, Lisk L1, The Open Network, Solana, Ethereum Swarm, and Massa. AgorApp has developed the most advanced chain-agnostic IDE in Web3 bringing in users from around the world to take our courses and challenges. Through AgorApp, Algorand will get new developers in both Web3 and Web2 from first-hand interactive coding lessons to spark interest for further growth. The goal of the project is to integrate the Tealscript language into our IDE and develop a proof of concept course to be displayed in our education catalog. From there, we have the ability to expand on education and create competition challenges for future consideration.',
