# Progress Updates

This guide explains how to post progress updates for your xGov-funded project and keep the community informed.

## Why Post Progress Updates?

Regular progress updates are important for:

- Keeping the community informed about your project's development
- Demonstrating accountability for xGov funding
- Building trust with the Algorand community
- Documenting your project's journey
- Attracting users, contributors, and partners

## Posting a Progress Update

To post a progress update:

1. Navigate to your proposal page
2. Scroll down to the "Progress Updates" section
3. Click on the "Add Update" button
4. Fill in the update form:
   - Title: A concise summary of your update
   - Content: Detailed information about your progress
   - Completion Percentage: Estimate of overall project completion
5. Click "Submit Update"

Your update will be immediately visible on your proposal page.

## Best Practices for Progress Updates

### Frequency

- Post updates at least once a month
- Update more frequently during active development phases
- Always update after reaching significant milestones

### Content

Include information about:

- What you've accomplished since the last update
- Challenges you've encountered and how you're addressing them
- Changes to your project plan or timeline
- Links to demos, repositories, or other resources
- Next steps and upcoming milestones

### Completion Percentage

The completion percentage should:

- Reflect your honest assessment of overall project progress
- Increase gradually as you complete milestones
- Align with your project roadmap
- Consider both development and non-development tasks (marketing, documentation, etc.)

## Example Progress Update

Here's an example of a good progress update:

**Title:** Beta Launch and New Features

**Content:**
We're excited to announce that we've launched the beta version of our DEX aggregator! Since our last update, we've:

1. Deployed the smart contracts to TestNet
2. Completed security audits with no critical issues
3. Launched the beta UI with support for 5 Algorand DEXes
4. Added wallet integration for Pera and Defly

We encountered some challenges with optimizing routing algorithms, but we've implemented a new approach that improved efficiency by 30%.

Next steps:
- Fix the 3 minor issues identified in the security audit
- Add support for 2 more DEXes
- Prepare for MainNet launch in approximately 3 weeks

You can try the beta at: https://our-project.com/beta

**Completion Percentage:** 75%

## Editing and Deleting Updates

Currently, progress updates cannot be edited or deleted after posting. Please review your updates carefully before submitting them.

If you need to correct information in a previous update, simply post a new update with the corrected information and reference the previous update.
