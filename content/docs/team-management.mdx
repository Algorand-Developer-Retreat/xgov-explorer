# Team Management

This guide explains how to claim proposals, manage team members, and use the whitelist feature in xGov Explorer.

## Claiming a Proposal

To claim a proposal, you need to have a GitHub account that matches the GitHub username associated with the proposal.

1. Navigate to the proposal page
2. Click on the "Claim This Proposal" button
3. Sign in with GitHub if you're not already signed in
4. If your GitHub username matches the one in the proposal, you'll be able to claim it
5. Once claimed, you'll be able to post progress updates and manage your team

## Managing Team Members

As a team owner, you can add and remove team members:

1. Go to your Team Dashboard
2. Click on the "Team Members" tab
3. To add a member, enter their GitHub username or Algorand address
4. To remove a member, click the "Remove" button next to their name

Team members can:
- Post progress updates
- View team analytics
- Access team resources

## Whitelist Feature

The whitelist feature allows you to specify which Algorand addresses are associated with your project:

1. Go to your Team Dashboard
2. Click on the "Whitelist" tab
3. Add Algorand addresses to your whitelist
4. These addresses will be recognized as official project addresses

This is useful for:
- Verifying official project wallets
- Tracking on-chain activity related to your project
- Providing transparency to the community

## Team Dashboard

The Team Dashboard provides a central place to manage all aspects of your project:

- Overview: See key metrics and recent activity
- Progress Updates: Post and manage updates
- Team Members: Manage your team
- Whitelist: Manage whitelisted addresses
- Settings: Configure your team profile

Access your Team Dashboard by clicking on your profile and selecting "Team Dashboard" or by clicking the "Team Dashboard" button on your claimed proposal page.
